    		<p>The <b style="color:Red; font-size:1.3em;">cha-cha-chá</b>, or simply cha-cha in the U.S., is a dance of Cuban 
    		origin.It is danced to the music of the same name introduced by Cuban
    		 composer and violinist Enrique Jorrin in the early 1950s. This rhythm was
    		  developed from the danzón-mambo. The name of the dance is an onomatopoeia
    		   derived from the shuffling sound of the dancers' feet.</p>
    		<p>Cha-cha-chá is danced to authentic Cuban music, although in ballroom 
    		   competitions it is often danced to Latin Pop or Latin Rock. The music for 
    		   the international ballroom cha-cha-chá is energetic and with a steady beat. 
    		   The Cuban cha-cha-chá may involve complex polyrhythms.</p>
    		<p>Styles of cha-cha-chá dance may differ in the place of the chasse in 
    		   the rhythmical structure.The original Cuban and the ballroom cha-cha 
    		   count is "two, three, chachacha", "four-and-one, two, three" or "one, two, 
    		   three, chacha". The dance does not start on the first beat of a bar, though
    		    it can start with a transfer of weight to the lead's right.</p>
    		<p>Nevertheless, many social dancers count "one, two, cha-cha-cha" and may 
    		   find it difficult to make the adjustment to the correct timing of the dance,
    		    "two, three, cha-cha, one".</p>

    		<p><b style="color:Red; font-size:1.3em;">Rhumba</b>, also known as ballroom rumba, is a genre of ballroom music and dance 
    		that appeared in the East Coast of the United States during the 1930s. It 
    		combined American big band music with Afro-Cuban rhythms, primarily the son 
    		cubano, but also conga and rumba. Taking its name from the latter, ballroom 
    		rumba differs completely from Cuban rumba both in its music and dance. Hence, 
    		authors prefer the Americanized spelling of the word (rhumba) to distinguish 
    		between them.</p>
    		<p>Two variations of rhumba with opposing step patterns are danced around the world. 
    		American style rumba was imported to America by band directors like Emil Coleman and
    		 Don Aspiazú between 1913 and 1935. The film Rumba, released in 1935, brought the 
    		 style to the attention of the general public. American style rhumba is taught 
    		 in a box step, known for its slow-quick-quick pattern danced on the 1, 3, and 
    		 4 beats of 4-beat music. International style rhumba was developed in Europe by 
    		 Monsieur Pierre after he compared the established American style with contemporary 
    		 Cuban dancers. International style is taught in a quick-quick-slow pattern danced 
    		 on the 2, 3, and 4 beats of 4 beat music, similar in step and motion to the cha-cha-cha.
    		 Both styles were canonized in 1955.</p>

    		<p><b style="color:Red; font-size:1.3em;">Salsa</b> is a popular form of social dance that originated in the Caribbean. 
    		The movements of salsa have origins in Cuban Son, Cha-cha-cha, Mambo and Puertorican
    		 Bomba & Plena and other dance forms, and the dance, along with the salsa music, 
    		 originated in the mid-1970s in New York.</p>
    		<p>In many styles of salsa dancing, as a dancer shifts their weight by stepping, 
    		the upper body remains level and nearly unaffected by the weight changes. Weight
    		 shifts cause the hips to move. Arm and shoulder movements are also incorporated.
    		  The Cuban Casino style of salsa dancing involves significant movement above the
    		   waist, with up-and-down shoulder movements and shifting of the ribcage.</p>
    		<p>The arms are used by the "lead" dancer to communicate or signal the "follower,"
    		 either in "open" or "closed" position. The open position requires the two dancers
    		  to hold one or both hands, especially for moves that involve turns, putting arms
    		   behind the back, or moving around each other, to name a few examples. 
    		   In the closed position, the leader puts the right hand on the follower's back,
    		    while the follower puts the left hand on the leader's shoulder.</p>

    		<p>The international Ballroom version of <b style="color:Red; font-size:1.3em;">Samba</b> is a lively, rhythmical dance 
    		with elements from Brazilian samba. It has recently been exposed to the American 
    		public in television programmes such as Strictly Come Dancing and Dancing with 
    		the Stars. It differs considerably from the original samba styles of Brazil, in
    		 particular it differs from Ballroom Samba in Brazil itself. In many other ways
    		  it though been influenced by the Brazilian version of samba, in particular 
    		  maxixe, and subsequently developed independently from samba in Brazil.</p>
    		<p>The ballroom samba has its origins in Samba of Brazil at the beginning of the 
    		20th century. Many steps can be traced back to the Maxixe danced in the 1910s.</p>
    		<p>Most steps are danced with a slight downward bouncing or dropping action. 
    		This action is created through the bending and straightening of the knees, with
    		 bending occurring on the beats of 1 and 2, and the straightening occurring between.
    		  However, unlike the bouncing of, e.g., Polka, there is no considerable bobbing. 
    		  Also, Samba has a specific hip action, different from that in ballroom Latin
    		   dances (Rumba and Cha-Cha-Cha).</p>

    		<p><b style="color:Red; font-size:1.3em;">Mambo</b> is a Latin dance of Cuba. Mambo was invented during the 1930s by the 
    		native Cuban musician and composer Arsenio Rodríguez,developed in Havana by
    		 Cachao and made popular by Dámaso Pérez Prado and Benny Moré.</p>
    		<p>In the late 1940s, Perez Prado came up with the dance for the mambo music and became 
    		the first person to market his music as "mambo", meaning "conversation with the gods" 
    		in the Kongo language, spoken by Congolese. After Havana, Prado moved his music to Mexico, 
    		where his music and the dance was adopted. The original mambo dance was characterized by
    		 freedom and complicated foot-steps. Some Mexican entertainers became well known dancers 
    		 like Tongolele, Adalberto Martínez, Rosa Carmina, Tin Tan and Lilia Prado. Most of these
    		  accompanied Prado in live presentations or were seen in Mexican films.</p>
    		<p>The original mambo dance contains no breaking steps or basic steps at all.
    		 The Cuban dance wasn't accepted by many professional dance teachers. Cuban dancers 
    		 would describe mambo as "feeling the music" in which sound and movement were merged
    		  through the body.Professional dance teachers in the US saw this approach to dancing 
    		  as "extreme," "undisciplined," and thus, deemed it necessary to standardize the 
    		  dance to present it as a sell-able commodity for the social or ballroom market.</p>

    		<p>In ballroom dancing, the <b style="color:Red; font-size:1.3em;">Jive</b> is a dance style that originated in the United
    		 States from African-Americans in the early 1930s. It was popularized in 1934 
    		 by Cab Calloway. It is a lively and uninhibited variation of the Jitterbug, 
    		 a form of Swing dance. Glenn Miller introduced his own jive dance in 1938 
    		 with the song "Doin' the Jive" which never caught on.</p>
    		<p>The jive is one of the five International Latin dances. In competition 
    		it is danced at a speed of 176 beats per minute, although in some cases this 
    		is reduced to between 128 and 160 beats per minute.</p>
    		<p>Many of its basic patterns are similar to these of the East Coast Swing 
    		with the major difference of highly syncopated rhythm of the Triple Steps 
    		(Chasses), which use straight eighths in ECS and hard swing in Jive. To the 
    		players of swing music in the 1930s and 1940s "Jive" was an expression denoting
    		 glib or foolish talk.[1] Or derived from the earlier generics for giouba of the
    		  African dance Juba dance verbal tradition.</p>

    		<p><b style="color:Red; font-size:1.3em;">Tango</b> is a partner dance that originated in the 1880s along the River Plate, 
    		the natural border between Argentina and Uruguay, and soon spread to the rest 
    		of the world.</p>
    		<p>Early tango was known as tango criollo (Creole tango). Today, there are many 
    		forms of tango extant. Popularly and among tango dancing circles, the authentic
    		 tango is considered to be the one closest to the form originally danced in 
    		 Argentina and Uruguay.</p>
    		<p>The tango consists of a variety of styles that developed in different regions
    		 and eras of Argentina as well as in other locations around the world. The dance 
    		 developed in response to many cultural elements, such as the crowding of the venue
    		  and even the fashions in clothing. The styles are mostly danced in either open
    		   embrace, where lead and follow have space between their bodies, or close embrace, 
    		   where the lead and follow connect either chest-to-chest (Argentine tango) or in 
    		   the upper thigh, hip area (American and International tango).</p>
