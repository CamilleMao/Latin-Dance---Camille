            <h1>Latin dance</h1>
            <p>Latin dance is a general label, and a term in partner dance competition
             jargon. It refers to types of ballroom dance and folk dance that (with few
              exceptions) originated in Latin America.</p>
            <p>The category of Latin dances in 
              the international dancesport competitions consists of the cha-cha-cha, rumba, 
              samba, paso doble, and also the jive of United States origin.

            <p>Social Latin dances (Street Latin) include salsa, mambo, merengue, Rumba, 
            bachata, bomba, plena, and the Argentine tango. There are many dances which 
            were popular in the first part of the 20th century, but which are now of only
             historical interest. The Cuban danzón is a good example.
            </p>
            <p>Perreo is a Puerto Rican dance associated with Reggaeton music with Jamaican 
            and Caribbean influences. Latin folk dances of Argentina include the chacarera, 
            gato, escondido and zamba. Typical Bolivian folk dances are the morenada, kullawada, 
            caporales and the recently created tinku. In Colombia one of the typical dances is 
            the cumbia.

   			<h2>Origin</h2>
			<p>Latin dance is mainly derived from three styles: Native Latin, European, and African influences.
			 The roots of Latin dance is deep and geographically embedded because it dates back to the fifteenth
			  century when indigenous dances were first recorded by Europeans.</p>
			<p>Its influence was first derived from their native roots, the Aztecs and Incas. When sixteenth 
			century seagoing explorers returned home to Portugal and Spain, they brought along tales of the 
			native peoples. According to Rachel Hanson, no one knows how long these dance traditions were established,
			 but they were already being developed and ritualized when they were observed by the Europeans. This 
			 suggests that these Native influences became the foundation for Latin dancing. Indigenous dance 
			 often told stories of everyday activities such as hunting, agriculture, or astronomy.</p>

   			<h2>Development</h2>			 
			<p>Many dance styles from different areas of the world were integrated into Latin dance. Such styles 
			came about which comprised the main categories of Latin dancing: Salsa, Mambo, Merengue, Rumba, 
			Cha Cha Cha, Bachata, and Samba. Music became the engine for Latin dancing because it guided the dance
			 steps with its measure, speed, and the feeling it evoked, from energetic to sensual. </p>
			<p>Various Latin American regions developed independent styles, and from each genre, or combination of styles, a 
			 different genre was born. For example, the Mambo which was created in the 1940s emerged through the 
			 combination of American swing and Cuban Son music.</p>

   			<h2>The Modernization<br> of Latin Dance</h2>			 
			<p>Following the music, movement history, and the rhythms, Latin dance evolved over time and individual 
			steps slowly shifted the repertoire of each dance. It has several different forms and many modernized styles
			 which creates a problem because it is shifting away from its Native, European, and African roots. </p>
			<p>A popular aerobic dance class known as Zumba is said to be influenced by Latin rhythm and steps. However, there are 
			  disagreements among Latin dancers about whether Zumba is true Latin dance. One skeptic is Darlin Garcia,
			   salsa dancer and instructor. She says: “You're taking a salsa step and in the middle of it you jump into 
			   a jumping jack. When you're mixing the two, that's just funny.”Zumba is including and expanding moves
			    from international and western influences such as Coast swing, belly dancing, and bhangra.</p>
